## To Do:

- [*] In `src` create a folder called `constants`.
- [*] Inside `src/constants` create a file `cookie-dough.js`. From `cookie-dough.js`, export an array of objects that represent the different cookie dough options you are offering.
- [*] In `src` create a folder called `hooks`.
- [ ] Inside `src/hooks` create a custom hook called `useCookieDough` that returns the cookie dough array found in `src/constants/cookie-dough.js`.
- [ ] In `src` create a folder called `state`.
- [ ] Inside `src/state` create a file called `cart-slice.js`. Try following [this guide](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) from the redux documentation to create a slice of state. (we already created the store, and provided it to the app)
