  "Baking Instructions: Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). Make sure the oven rack is in the center position. Prepare Baking Sheets: Line baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease them with cooking spray. Place frozen cookie dough balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Cool and Serve: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your freshly baked chocolate chip cookies!";
